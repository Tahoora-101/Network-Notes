# Network+ Compendium: A Structured Journey

This repository is my curated knowledge base for the CompTIA Network+ certification, built as part of my journey toward a Master's in Cybersecurity Research.

## My Approach

Rather than passive note-taking, I focus on:
- **Conceptual Clarity:** Using analogies (like the "Neighborhood" for IP subnets) to ground abstract concepts.
- **Visual Learning:** Creating and sourcing clear diagrams to illustrate complex systems.
- **Practical Connection:** Always linking theory to real-world security implications and troubleshooting.

## Contents

1.  **OSI & TCP/IP Models** - The fundamental layers of network communication.
2.  **Networking Devices** - From routers and switches to firewalls and load balancers.
3.  **Cloud & Virtual Networking** - NFV, VPC, and modern infrastructure.
4.  **Protocols & Ports** - The language of network communication.
... [and so on]

## Purpose

This serves as a living document of my foundational knowledge in networking—the bedrock upon which all cybersecurity is built.
