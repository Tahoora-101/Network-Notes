# üîå Networking Devices (1.2)

Networking devices are the **building blocks of a network**. Each device has a specific role in moving, securing, or managing traffic.

---

## üì° Router
A **Router** connects different networks together and routes data based on IP addresses.  

- Works at **OSI Layer 3 (Network Layer)**  
- Chooses the best path for data to travel  
- Can connect diverse network types (LAN, WAN, fiber, copper)  

### Variants
- **Layer 2 = Switches** (forward traffic by MAC)  
- **Layer 3 = Routers** (forward traffic by IP)  
- **Layer 3 Switch = Hybrid** (switching + routing in one device)  

---

## üîÄ Switch
A **Switch** connects multiple devices within the same network and forwards traffic based on **MAC addresses**.  

- Works at **OSI Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**  
- Uses **ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)** for fast, hardware-based forwarding  
- Forms the **core of most enterprise networks**  

### Types
- **Standard Switch:** Forwards traffic based only on MAC  
- **PoE Switch:** Provides both **data and electrical power** over the same Ethernet cable (for IP phones, cameras, wireless APs)  
- **Multilayer Switch:** Adds Layer 3 routing functions on top of switching  

---

## üî• Firewall
A **Firewall** protects a network by filtering traffic based on rules.  

- Can operate at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** and above  
- Traditionally filtered by **ports** (e.g., TCP 80 = web traffic)  
- **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW):** Can filter by **applications** (e.g., block Facebook, allow Gmail)  

### Extra Features
- **NAT (Network Address Translation):** Hides private IPs behind public IPs  
- **VPN Support:** Encrypts traffic between sites  
- **Dynamic Routing:** Some firewalls also act as routers  

---

## üõ° IDS vs IPS
Security systems that monitor and respond to intrusions.  

- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System):** Detects malicious traffic and alerts admins (monitor only).  
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):** Detects and blocks malicious traffic automatically (active protection).  

üëâ Think of IDS as a **security camera** (watch + alert) and IPS as a **security guard** (watch + stop).  

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Load Balancer
A **Load Balancer** spreads incoming traffic across multiple servers so no single server gets overloaded.  

### Functions
- **High availability:** Keeps apps online even if one server fails  
- **SSL Offload:** Handles encryption/decryption so servers don‚Äôt have to  
- **Caching:** Serves repetitive requests directly for speed  
- **QoS:** Prioritizes certain traffic  
- **Content Switching:** Routes requests based on app type (e.g., API vs website)  

---

## üåê Proxy
A **Proxy server** acts as a middleman between clients and the internet.  

### Uses
- **Caching:** Saves bandwidth & speeds up browsing  
- **Security:** URL filtering, content scanning, access control  
- **Types:**  
  - **Explicit Proxy:** Users configure it manually in settings  
  - **Transparent Proxy:** Works silently, no user config needed  

---

## üíæ SAN vs NAS
Both are network storage solutions but work differently:  

- **SAN (Storage Area Network):**  
  - **Block-level storage** (like a dedicated storage database. The server sees it as a raw disk and can manage it however it wants)  
  - High speed, high control, heavy-duty use. 
  - Often used in enterprise data centers  

- **NAS (Network Attached Storage):**  
  - **File-level storage** (like a storage folder inside a shared network database. It‚Äôs already organized with files and folders; you just access what you need without worrying about how it‚Äôs stored underneath.)  
  - Easier setup, great for file sharing/home use  

‚ö° Both require **high bandwidth** and often use **isolated networks**.  

---

## üì∂ Wireless Networks
- Multiple **Access Points (APs)** cover an area so devices can connect anywhere. 
- Users can roam seamlessly between APs without losing connection. 
- Each AP needs security settings and access rules.  

### Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)
- Central management for all APs.  
- Pushes configurations, security updates, and monitors usage from one place.

---

## üöÄ Networking Functions

### CDN (Content Delivery Network)
- **Think of it like mini copies of a website or video stored closer to users.**
- Instead of everyone hitting the main server, users get content from the nearest edge server ‚Üí faster loading. 
- Improves global performance  
- Example: Watching YouTube in Kuwait? You get the nearest YouTube server copy, not the origin server in the US.

---

### VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- Creates an **encrypted tunnel** for secure remote access (like a secure, invisible tunnel over the internet)
- **VPN Concentrator/Head-End:** Central hub for managing all tunnels, traffic, and authentication. 
- Can be:  
  - **Hardware appliance:** Used by big orgs for performance  
  - **Software/OS-integrated:** Common for smaller orgs or individuals
- Often works with firewalls for encryption (IPsec/SSL).

---

### QoS (Quality of Service)
- Prioritizes important traffic (like VoIP, video calls, real-time apps)  
- Also called **packet shaping**  
- Built into routers, switches, firewalls.
- Configurable per app, device, or network.
- **Analogy**: VIP cars get the fast lane, regular cars wait.

---

### TTL (Time To Live)
- Maximum lifetime of a data packet before it‚Äôs discarded. 
- Prevents **endless routing loops**   
- Decreases by 1 at each router hop  
- Defaults: **Windows = 128 hops, Linux/Mac = 64 hops**   

---

### Routing Loops
- Packet keeps bouncing between Router1 ‚Üî Router2 (back and forth)  
- TTL eventually drops the packet to stop looping (When TTL = 0 ‚Üí packet is dropped)
- Often caused by **misconfigured static routes**  

---

### IP (Internet Protocol)
- Responsible for addressing & packet delivery  
- TTL is built into IP to stop looping packets  

---

### DNS (Domain Name System)
- Converts human-readable names (e.g., `google.com`) into IPs  
- Uses **TTL in seconds** for cache expiry  
- After TTL expires, DNS queries are refreshed  

---

# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud & Virtual Networking (1.3)

Cloud computing allows organizations to run servers, networks, and applications **virtually** instead of relying solely on physical hardware.

---

## üåê Virtual Networks
- Virtualizes the entire physical network (routers, switches, cables, servers)  
- Server farms are shifted into virtualized environments  

### NFV (Network Function Virtualization)
- Converts physical devices (routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers) into **virtual devices**  
- Virtualized devices work just like physical ones  
- Managed centrally through a **hypervisor**  
- Can deploy **VMs, containers, and fault-tolerant setups**  

---

## üè¢ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- A **private, isolated cloud environment** with virtual routers, switches, firewalls, and load balancers  
- Each component can be managed separately, like individual departments in a company  

### Communication
- **Cloud Router:** Connects devices **within the VPC**  
- **VPN:** Secure tunnel for external access to VPC  

---

## üîó Connecting to the Cloud
- **VPN:** Encrypted connection for secure access (private access)  
- **Internet Gateway / VPC Gateway:** Public access for internet users (open access)  
- **VPC NAT:** Allows cloud to access external networks while **hiding private IPs**  

---

## üîå VPC Endpoint
- Direct connection between **private cloud networks**  
- No internet middleman, just **private communication**  

---

## üõ° Security in the Cloud

### Security Groups
- Rules applied to **individual virtual NICs (VNICs)**  
- Can target specific VMs, ports, IPs, protocols  
- **Flexible and granular**  

### Security Lists
- Rules applied **subnet-wide**  
- Less flexible, applies to all devices in the subnet  
- Harder to manage; misconfigurations can create **security holes**  

üí° **Best Practice:** Prefer Security Groups for fine-grained, safe control  

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment Models

### Private Cloud
- Fully controlled by you or provider  
- Used only by your organization  
- Example: Banks, government, large corporations  

### Public Cloud
- Managed by cloud provider  
- Shared infrastructure, isolated data  
- Examples: Gmail, Dropbox  

### Hybrid Cloud
- Combines private & public cloud  
- Example: Customer data stored privately, website hosted publicly  

---

## üíª Cloud Service Models

### SaaS (Software as a Service)
- Use the application **without managing infrastructure**  
- Provider handles updates, servers, storage  
- Example: Office 365, Gmail, Dropbox  

### IaaS / HaaS (Infrastructure / Hardware as a Service)
- You manage: OS, storage, apps, updates  
- Provider manages: Physical servers, network, hardware  
- Example: Microsoft Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine  

### PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- Build, test, deploy apps without managing servers or OS  
- Focus is on **code**, not infrastructure  
- Example: Google App Engine, Heroku, Salesforce

| Networking Term      | Analogy                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Network**         | The **road system** trucks use.        |
| **IP (Internet Protocol)** | The **truck** carrying your packages. |
| **TCP/UDP**         | The **packages** inside the truck.     |
| **IP Address**      | Your **house address**.                |
| **Ports**           | The **specific drop-off spot** (kitchen, bedroom, etc.). |

---

## üöö TCP vs UDP

| Feature | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) | UDP (User Datagram Protocol) |
|---------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Delivery Guarantee** | ‚úÖ Yes (acknowledgements, retries) | ‚ùå No (fire & forget) |
| **Use Cases** | Email, web, file transfer | Video calls, gaming, streaming |
| **Speed** | Slower, reliable | Faster, no checks |
| **Handshake** | üîÅ 3-Way Handshake | üö´ None |

### üîç TCP Details:
- **3-Way Handshake**: `SYN ‚Üí SYN-ACK ‚Üí ACK`
- **Acknowledgement System**: Confirms delivery; resends errors.
- **Flow Control**: Receiver can slow/speed packet flow.
- **Orderly Delivery**: Guarantees correct order.
- **Teardown**: Gracefully closes connection.

### ‚ö° UDP Details:
- No error checks.
- No delivery confirmation.
- No guaranteed order.
- üöÄ **Super fast** ‚Üí great for live calls/gaming.

---

## üéØ Multiplexing

Example: **Zoom**  
- Video/audio call ‚Üí `UDP`  
- Chat messages ‚Üí `TCP`

---

## üîë Ports & Sockets

| Type                | Port Range | Used By |
|--------------------|-----------|--------|
| **Ephemeral Ports** | `1024‚Äì65535` | Temporary, often client side |
| **Non-Ephemeral Ports** | `0‚Äì1023` | Permanent, often server side |

üí° Both client & server **can use either range**.

### IPv4 Socket Structure:
- **Client Socket:** Client IP + protocol + client port
- **Server Socket:** Server IP + protocol + server port

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Notes on Ports
- TCP and UDP **can share the same port number** but are separate services.
- Ports are **not a security feature** ‚Äî don‚Äôt rely on them for security.
- Server ports should be **well-known & predictable**.

| 1000BASE-SX    | Gigabit Ethernet (Short)  | Fiber  | 1 Gbps        |

---

## Deciphering the Standard
- **Numbers** ‚Üí represent speed (e.g., `1000BASE-T` = 1 Gbps)  
- **BASE** ‚Üí Baseband (single frequency signal transmission)  
- **Media Indicators**:  
  - `T` = Twisted Pair Copper  
  - `F` = Fiber  
  - `SX` = Short Wavelength/Short Distance Fiber  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** IEEE does not officially guarantee strict correlation between the acronym and specification details.

# üî¨ Optical Fiber Networking

## Key Characteristics
- No RF (radio frequency) interference which makes it difficult to tap or monitor.
-Data is transmitted by LIGHT.
-It‚Äôs signal degrades slowly over the length than copper. Eg: Copper can degrade quickly if the length keeps increasing but fiber does it more slowly.
-It does not have RF so basically it cannot leak signals or be interfered with.

---

## Fiber Cable Structure
1. **Core**: The central glass strand where light travels and bounces.  
2. **Cladding**: A glass layer surrounding the core. Has a lower refractive index to trap light inside the core via total internal reflection.  
3. **Coating (Buffer)**: A plastic (usually acrylic) protective layer that cushions the fragile core and cladding ‚Äî first line of real protection.  
4. **Cable Jacket**: The tough outer covering that shields the entire assembly (can include multiple fibers, strength members, and ripcords).

# üñß Copper Cabling & Network Transceivers

## ü™¢ Importance of Cabling
- Cables are the **backbone of networking**; even wireless tech relies on wired infrastructure.
- **Proper planning** is crucial because once installed, cables are **hard and expensive** to remove or redo.

---

## üßµ Twisted Pair Copper Cabling
- Pairs of wires carry '+' and '-' signals for transmit/receive.
- Twisting **reduces interference** and **crosstalk**; each pair has a unique twist rate.
- Multiple wire pairs ensure redundancy and higher data integrity. **This means the system can often correct errors or continue functioning even if one pair is degraded, by using the combined signal from all pairs**.
- Cable speed is determined by **signal quality and standards** (not just the cable itself).
- Cables must be manufactured by the standards of the IEEE to support the desired speed and distance.
- **Categories**:
  - **Cat5**: Up to `1 Gbps`.
  - **Cat6/Cat7**: Higher speeds, longer distances, better shielding.

---

## üì° Coaxial Cable
